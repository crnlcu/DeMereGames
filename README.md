Game 1, you throw a fair die and you win if you throw a six in at most 4 throws; 
Game 2, you throw 2 fair dice and you win if you throw a double-six in at most 24 throws of two fair dice.
<br>
Game 1
<br>
prob(not have a 6 in 4 throws) = (5/6) ** 4 

prob(have a 6 in 4 throws) = 1 -(5/6)**4 = 0.5177469136
<br>
Game 2
<br>
prob(double-six in single throw) = 1/6 * 1/6 =1/36
<br>
prob(not double-six in single throw) = 35/36  (one case)

prob(not having a double-six in 24 throws) = (35/36) **24

prob( having a double-six in 24 throws) = 1 -(35/36) **24 = 0.4914038761

<br>
How many throws to have Game 2 more favourable thant Game 1?
