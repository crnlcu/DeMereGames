## Game 1

You throw a fair die and you win if you throw a six in at most 4 throws.

- Probability of **not** having a 6 in 4 throws: `(5/6)^4`  
- Probability of having a 6 in 4 throws: `1 - (5/6)^4 = 0.5177469136`

---

## Game 2

You throw 2 fair dice and you win if you throw a double-six in at most 24 throws.

- Probability of double-six in a single throw: `1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36`  
- Probability of not getting double-six in a single throw: `35/36`  
- Probability of not having a double-six in 24 throws: `(35/36)^24`  
- Probability of having a double-six in 24 throws: `1 - (35/36)^24 = 0.4914038761`
