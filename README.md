    <p>
        <strong>Game 1:</strong> You throw a fair die and you win if you throw a six in at most 4 throws.
    </p>
    <p>
        Probability of not having a 6 in 4 throws: <code>(5/6)^4</code><br>
        Probability of having a 6 in 4 throws: <code>1 - (5/6)^4 = 0.5177469136</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Game 2:</strong> You throw 2 fair dice and you win if you throw a double-six in at most 24 throws of two dice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Probability of double-six in a single throw: <code>1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36</code><br>
        Probability of not getting double-six in a single throw: <code>35/36</code><br>
        Probability of not having a double-six in 24 throws: <code>(35/36)^24</code><br>
        Probability of having a double-six in 24 throws: <code>1 - (35/36)^24 = 0.4914038761</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> How many throws are needed for Game 2 to be more favorable than Game 1?<br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> At least 26 throws
